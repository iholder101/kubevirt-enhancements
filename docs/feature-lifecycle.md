# KubeVirt Feature Lifecycle

## Summary

KubeVirt requires a clear policy on how features are introduced,
evaluated and finally graduated or removed.

This document defines the steps and policies to follow in order
to manage a feature and its lifecycle in KubeVirt.

The document is focusing on introducing features in
a stable API (CRD) version, e.g. `kubevirt.io/v1`.

## Overview

KubeVirt has grown into a matured virtualization management solution
with a large set of features.

New features are being proposed and added regularly to its portfolio.

With time, the challenge of supporting and maintaining such a large
set of features raised the need to re-examine their relevance.
It also raised the need to examine with more care features graduation.

We would like to see features being evaluated carefully
before they are introduced, while they are experimented with and
proven to be actually in use (and useful) before graduating.

> **Note**: Once a feature graduates, it is included in a
> General Availability (GA) release with its functionality available
> to all users. GA features need to comply with [semver](https://semver.org/)
> which add constraints on their ability to change (including deprecation).

### Kubevirt's release cycle

Each Kubevirt release cycle is split to 3 different phases:
1. **Design phase**: During this phase the community will be focused on creating and reviewing VEP PRs.
In a higher level, during this period the community would start crafting how the current release will look like;
ensure there are enough reviewers and approvers to cover the VEPs, discuss priorities, etc.
The VEP freeze marks the end of this phase.
2. **Implementation phase**: This phase is centered around the implementation of the VEPs that were merged in the design phase.
PRs that implement a VEP would be required to reference it in the PR description, which will result in the bot adding
an `approved-vep` label to the PR.
During this phase, the community will help review `approved-vep` PRs which will be considered as the highest priority PRs to review.
The code freeze marks the end of this phase.
3. **Stabilization phase**: During this time the community will focus around stabilization, allowing only bug PRs to be merged.
The Kubevirt release marks the end of this phase....

Notes:
- It is recommended to submit VEPs for the next releases as soon as possible.
It is not needed, and not recommended, to wait to the design phase in order to do so.
- PRs that are not related to any VEPs would also be reviewed and implemented during the implementation phase,
but they will be considered to have lower priority.
- Community members, especially VEP authors, are expected to participate in reviews.
Those who focus solely on their own work may have their own submissions deprioritized.

## Feature Lifecycle Policy
The feature lifecycle policy on how to define a feature lifecycle is influenced by
processes and policies from the Kubernetes project.
These sources are scattered around, each focusing on different
aspects of a feature:
- [Feature Gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
- [Graduation](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/21/moving-forward-from-beta/)
- [Changing the API](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md)
- [Deprecation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/)

The policy takes the top-down approach, starting with the high level
flow that a common feature will traverse through.

Both feature graduation and discontinuation flows are covered.
Including the implications on users.

### Feature Gates
It is important to differentiate between Feature Gates and feature configuration.
- Feature Gate: A flag that controls the presence or availability of a feature in the cluster.
- Feature configuration: Cluster or workload level configuration that allows an admin or user
  (depending on the feature) to control aspects of a feature operation.
  A common usage is to determine if features are opt-in or opt-out by default.

In other words, a Feature Gate flag is solely intended to control
feature lifecycle. It should not be confused and used as a cluster
configurable enablement of the functionality.
In cases where the cluster admin should control a functionality,
regardless to the feature stage, dedicated configuration field/s
should be included.

#### Why is a feature gate important?

A feature gate is needed for several reasons:
- To force the user to **explicitly enable it**, therefore expressing an agreement to enable an experimental feature
  that might be broken.
- To loudly express that the API can be changed in a breaking way or even entirely removed at any moment
  (according to the graduation phase. See [Graduation Phases](#graduation-phases) below).
- To loudly express that we are not committing or promising anything regarding the feature's quality.
  It could be broken, could be buggy, could harm security, scale, performance, etc.
  (according to the graduation phase. See [Graduation Phases](#graduation-phases) below).
- To (dramatically) lower the bar for new alpha features.
  This raises the reviewers' confidence that a regression would not introduce to anyone not explicitly enabling the gate.

#### Can a VEP choose to not include a feature gate?

It can be decided that a VEP would not need a feature gate.
However, in order to do so, the VEP author has to provide a strong reasoning and justification.

For example, the following reasons are considered as weak reasons for avoiding a feature gate:
- It is a simple change.
- It is off by default, hence safe.
- It keeps backward compatibility.

Generally, avoiding a feature gate is expected to be extremely rare.

### Feature Stages

A feature follows this sequence (optional steps are shown in parentheses).
All VEP updates and implementation work are tied to the [KubeVirt release cycle](#kubevirts-release-cycle).

1. Open a VEP tracking issue.
2. Create and merge the initial VEP PR (expected during the **design phase**).
3. Implement the feature with one or more PRs (expected during the **implementation phase**).
4. (If the implementation diverges from the approved VEP, submit a VEP update PR to keep the proposal in sync).
5. Release the feature as **Alpha** (experimental) at the end of the current release cycle. In the **next** release cycle:
6. (If the feature is not yet ready for Beta, submit a VEP update during the design phase that describes the planned work.
   Implement the agreed changes during the implementation phase.)
7. To graduate to **Beta** (pre-release for evaluation):
   Submit a VEP update during the design phase that explicitly names the upcoming release as the Beta target.
   Implement the agreed changes during the implementation phase.
   After all implementation PRs are merged, submit a PR to bump the version from Alpha to Beta. 
8. (If the feature is not yet ready for GA, submit another VEP update during the design phase and implement during the implementation phase.)
9. To graduate to **General Availability (GA)** (graduation):
   Submit a VEP update during the design phase that explicitly names the upcoming release as the GA target.
   Implement the agreed changes during the implementation phase.
   After all implementation PRs are merged, submit a PR to bump the version from Beta to GA.

[Removal](#removal) of features is widely discussed later
in this document.

#### Virtualization Enhancement Proposal (a.k.a. VEP)
As the first step for introducing a new feature, a formal proposal is
expected to be shared for public review via the
[Kubevirt Enhancements](https://github.com/kubevirt/enhancements) repository.

As mentioned above, the first step would be to open a [VEP tracker issue](https://github.com/kubevirt/enhancements/issues/new?template=vep.md).
The issue ID will be considered as the VEP's unique ID.
The issue is expected to remain open until the feature either reaches GA or is dropped.
It is the VEP author's responsibility to keep the issue up-to-date and reference all related VEP update PRs and implementation PRs.
The issue can serve as a platform for general conversations regarding the VEP.

This is the way to transparently share a proposal in order to evaluate a new feature.
The proposal needs to include motivation, goals, implementation details
and phases. Review the [proposal template](https://github.com/kubevirt/enhancements/blob/main/veps/NNNN-vep-template/vep.md)
for more information.

#### Graduation phases
- **Alpha**:
  An initial release of the feature for experimental purposes.
  Recommended for non-production usages, evaluation or testing.

  The API is considered unstable and may change significantly.
  There are no backward compatibility considerations and it can
  be removed at any time.

  For this reason, the bar for adding new alpha features should be fairly low.
  For example, if it is not known how the feature's API will look like,
  it should be okay (and even encouraged) to experiment an API and later
  perform dramatic breaking changes to it in another alpha round.

  The period in which a feature can remain in Alpha is limited,
  assuring features are not piling up without control.
  See [release stage transition table](#release-stage-transition-table)
  for more information.

  The feature presence is controlled using a Feature-Gate (FG) during
  runtime. It must be specified for the feature to be active.

- **Beta**:
  The first release that can be evaluated with care in production.
  Acting as a pre-release, its main objective is to collect feedback
  from users to assure its usefulness and readiness for graduation.
  If there is no confidence of usage or usefulness, it may remain in
  this stage for some time.

  The API is considered stable with care not to break backward compatibility
  with previous beta releases.
  This implies that fields may only be added during this stage,
  not removed or renamed.
 
  As opposed to Alpha, the bar for Beta graduation should be fairly high.
  Generally, a feature should be graduating to Beta only when there is a high
  probability that it is already ready for GA.
  In fact, the ideal situation is that there are no changes at all between Beta
  and GA graduation.
  Minor changes are acceptable during Beta. However, major changes would possibly
  cause the feature to be degraded to Alpha again in order to perform more experimentation. 

  The period in which a feature can remain in Beta is limited,
  assuring features are not piling up without control.
  See [release stage transition table](#release-stage-transition-table)
  for more information.

  The feature presence is controlled using a Feature-Gate (FG) during
  runtime. It must be specified for the feature to be active.

- **GA**:
  The feature graduated to general-availability (GA) and is now part of
  the core features.

  The API is considered stable with care not to break backward compatibility
  with the previous releases.

  The bar for GA graduation is very high.

  The feature functionality is no longer controlled by a FG.

#### Removal
If a feature is targeted for deprecation and retirement,
it needs to pass a deprecation process, depending on its current
release stage (Alpha, Beta, GA).

For more details, see [here](#deprecation-and-removal).

#### Release Stage Transition Table
The following table summarized the different release stages with their
transition requirements and restrictions.

| Stage          | Period range    | F.Gate | Removal Availability       |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|----------------------------|
| Alpha          | 1 to 2 releases | YES    | Between **minor** releases |
| Beta           | 1 to 3 releases | YES    | Between **minor** releases |
| GA             | -               | NO     | Between **major** releases |

Through Alpha and Beta feature releases, a FG must be set in order
for the feature to function.
By default, no FG is specified, therefore the feature is disabled.

If a feature is not able to transition to the next stage in the defined period,
it should be removed automatically.

> **Note**: Exceptions to the period range may apply
> if 2/3 of active maintainers come to agreement to prolong
> a specific feature.

### Deprecation and Removal
One reason for features to go through the Alpha and Beta stages,
is the opportunity to examine their usefulness and adoption.
Same goes with major releases that intentionally allow breaking
backward compatibility (as specified by [semver](https://semver.org/)).

Therefore, it is only natural that some features will not graduate
between the stages, or will be found irrelevant after some time and be
removed when transitioning between major releases.

#### Major Releases
KubeVirt follows semver versioning, in which major versions may
break API compatibility. Therefore, discontinuation of features
is somehow simpler when incrementing the major version.

However, this is not without a cost.
When a new major release is introduced, the previous one is still maintained
and supported, something that does not exist with minor releases.

#### The Deprecation Flow (for Minor releases)
Only Alpha and Beta features can be removed during a minor release.

These are the steps needed to deprecate & remove a feature:
- Proposal: Prepare a proposal to remove a feature with proper
  reasoning, phases, exact timelines and functional alternatives (if any).
  The proposal should be reviewed and approved.
- Notification: Notify the project community about the feature
  discontinuation based on the approved proposal.
  All details of the plan should be provided to allow users and possibly
  down-stream projects to adjust.
  Use all community media options to distribute this information
  (e.g. mailing list, slack channel, community meetings).
- Deprecation warnings: Add deprecation warnings at runtime to warn users
  that the feature is planned to be removed.
  Warnings should be raised when:
  - Feature API fields are accessed.
  - Feature FG is activated.
  - Behavior related to the feature is detected (optional).
- Removal: Feature removal involves removing the core functionality
  of a feature and its exposed API.
  - The core implementation can be removed in two steps:
    - The FG is removed by assuring it is never reported as set
      (i.e. even if it is left by the operator configured, internally
       it is ignored).
      At this stage, the core implementation will follow the FG conditions
      and therefore from the outside the feature is inactive.
    - In case there are no side effects, the core implementation code can
      be removed.
  - The API types are not to be removed, as it may have implications
    with the underlying storage which has already persisted them.
    Kubernetes has not removed fields, it just kept them around with the
    warning that they have been deprecated and no longer available.

    While keeping fields around for a period of a release or two makes
    sense, beyond a limited period it adds a burden on dragging leftover
    fields around to eternity.

### Exceptions
While the project strives to maintain a stable contract with its users,
there may be scenarios where the policy described here will not be a fit.

Therefore, it should be acceptable to have exceptions from time to time
given a very good reasoning and an agreement from 2/3 of the project
maintainers (also known as "approvers").

### Miscellaneous

- New features are to be introduced to major and minor release versions only.
  For clarification, this implies that new features are **not** to be backport.
- CI:
  - Alpha stage features should not be gating on CI.
  - Beta and GA features should be gating on CI.
- API fields may be marked with the following information:
  - Description
  - Release stage (alpha/beta/ga) and release version.

  It is left to a follow-up implementation proposal to define the exact format and
  required/optional information.
